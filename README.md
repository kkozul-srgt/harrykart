# Description
Harry-Kart in a special kind of horse racing.

The horses participating have a base speed, they can run with that speed indefinitely.
The track is a 1000 meters loop and is divided in lanes, each horse runs on a lane and every lane has the same length.   
The horses run the first loop at their base speed but at the end of each loop they find a power-up or power-down.

The power-ups/downs are numbers, negative or positive, representing how much the horse speeds up or slows down.

Your task is to compute the top 3 ranking.

## Example

### Input

**Number of loops:** 3

**Start List:**

| Lane | Horse name     | Base speed |
|------|----------------|------------|
| 1    | TIMETOBELUCKY  | 10         |
| 2    | CARGO DOOR     | 10         |
| 3    | HERCULES BOKO  | 10         |
| 4    | WAIKIKI SILVIO | 10         |

**Power-Ups/Downs:**

| Loop | Lane 1 | Lane 2 | Lane 3 | Lane 4 |
|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1    | 1      | 1      | 0      | -2     |
| 2    | 1      | -1     | 2      | -2     |

### Result

| Position | Horse Name    |
|----------|---------------|
| 1st      | TIMETOBELUCKY |
| 2nd      | HERCULES BOKO |
